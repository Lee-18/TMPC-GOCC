This is the relevant code for Transferable Model Predictive Control-based Group Occupant Centric Control (TMPC-GOCC) study, which can be divided into the following four parts:

**VirtualTestbed**: virtual testbed development     

**PredictionModel**: the development of the prediction models used in MPC    

**TransferLearning**: the transfer learning method used for group thermal comfort model   

**MPC**: TMPC-GOCC development and evaluation  

**ReportAndSlide**: the thesis report and the presentation slides

Each subfolder contains a more detailed README to its contents
